## ITMD 362, Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership/join page for Chicagoâ€™s Museum of Contemporary Art at
https://experience.mcachicago.org/donate/contribute1?ct=6 (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:

* Android Guidelines:

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2. an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL): https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/adaptivity-and-layout/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
In my design the appearance will be consistent and not that the background is being
pulled away for some parts. The text would be readable and different sizes of text
will be seen to catch users attention to portray whats important to read and
what's not as important such as the directions to how to purchase is important.
Also layout in different screen sizes would change according to what works for
that screen size.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL): https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/user-interaction/data-entry/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
Data Entry by users need to just right. I would make sure the users are only
filling out the fields they really need to and options will be present plus it should
be easier for users to know what fields to fill and how to submit their data. The
current design confuses users about what to fill and how to submit, there is a
bunch of extra information provided that's not needed like why is the adding a promo
code and submit button at the top of the page. That confuses users if they should
submit that button or press the continue button. This is clear in my design, there
aren't any extra buttons and the 'Add to Cart' button is clear.

* HCI Guideline Three (URL):
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
