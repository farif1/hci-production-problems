## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette
(you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make).
Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=10p0u0kllll3Ayfctr2udfDQg9W
Your Rationale: The reason why I chose the shade of orange is because I think
colors show emotions and the color orange shows enthusiasm and frustration at
the same time which is what the emotions we have during games. Also my colors
go from dark to white to show light and dark shades again to show the two different
emotions of frustration and enthusiasm.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=52F0h0ks5nA5NzGjAs6C3hHVo9o
Your Rationale: I used shades of green and yellow because of springtime. My colors
are more on the color side rather than the whiter or darker side because the site
is for a garden so more color is needed.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=31V110kLEP+8yR5osMHS1rJVUgj
Your Rationale: My colors are on the very bright side because kids like bright colors and
that helps them learn. The colors I used are shades of red blue and yellow to bring
attention to the primary colors which can help kids learn just not the alphabets
but also colors.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=14r1c0k9bll28sV5bo-ediTmehP
Your Rationale: I think something like cybersecurity is like serious but fun and its
for young adults or adults. This makes them like subtle colors rather than very bright
colors which is why my palette is on the lighter/whiter side rather than bright or dark
side. I chose a monochromatic palette because I don't think young adults wants to see a
lot of different colors just popping up instead shades of different colors would be more
appropriate. I chose a nice purple because it just made me think of the Women in
cybersecurity site.
